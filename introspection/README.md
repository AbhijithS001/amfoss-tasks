a. Why must we choose you?

 I believe that I can be of help to the club. I know very little coding that I learned by myself (I was a bio student in +1 and +2). So by selecting me I can learn more coding and contribute back to the club.
 
b. What is your plan for the next 6 months?

 Plans include studying for the semester exam and also working for AmFOSS club if i get selected. I also plan to complete CS50 course and learn Python.
 
 c. How would you contribute back to the club?
 
 I like to participate in various contest contested by AmFOSS and also other contests and try my maximum to win it for the club. I am also ready to help others in learning coding.
 
 d. Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
 Yes, I have a feedback on the selection process. I am a student with bio background and I could only solve 2 tasks from my knowledge. I tried to solve other tasks but I couldn't. At the same time, I am learning new things in coding. So please take this into consideration for the selection process. Thank you.
