1. To clone the Github Repository, I used the command - git clone "https://github.com/gauthamk02/TerminalHunt.git"
5. To access the commit log of the repository, I used the command - "git log"
6. Used "git branch -a" to see all the local and remote branches of the repository
8. Used "find . -name <file_name>.txt" to find the file.
9. Used "git merge <branch_name>" for merging the branch with the file into main.
